            <h1>The Scottish Conservative Party</h1>
      <p>I live in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland>Scotland</a>. I am a Tory. The constant attacks by the SNP and Labour can be unpleasant, but still it's fun to work with the Party on many issues and campaigns. CFS, the party youth wing in Scotland, is a great bunch of people. We have two major opponents in Scottish politics:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>SNP</li>
      <li>Labour</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since the 2017 General Election, however, we have become a significant force in Scottish politics.</p>
